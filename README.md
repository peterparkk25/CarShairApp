# CarShairApp

# In order to run this APP, please fork and clone it and npm install to double check that you have all the dependecies necessary to run this APP.

# Once you have the dependencies, npm start or expo start and the expo should pop up a webpage.

# From the localhost, you can scan the QR code with your expo app on your phone or you can choose to run on the simulator provided from expo.

# When the APP starts, you are presented with a login page. You can enter email and password accordingly

# They are temporary textinput boxes that hold the state in a variable but does not send it anywhere yet

# Once you click the "LOGIN" button, you are presented with the home page of the app along with the 4 bottom tabs now visible

# First tab is just the Home tab that you see right after the login

# Second tab is the host your own car tab where you can enter information about your own car that you wish to rent out, similar to the log in screen, these are temporary textinputs that don't send the values to an endpoint at the moment. Once you click the submit button, you will be prompted with an alert that lets you know your car was submitted

# Third tab is the rent a car tab. Because of styling and API I chose to stick to just the make and model of the car. If no make is selected the model dropdown menu will not display anything. Once a make is selected from the top dropdown bar, you will see an option to click a model from the specific make that you chose. Once you have the make and model that you would like to search selected, you can click the search button and the next page will display the results. Again, this is just a mock page where it should show an inventory of the cars currently listed at CarShair with the speicifications that the user chose but right now it only passes down the make and model as the result.

# The Fourth and final tab is just a mock user profile which would contain a profile picture, maybe a banner, and basic information about the account holder.

# Thank you for taking the time to review my APP
